## Projects

If you find anything useful, [let me know](mailto:lodatom@gmail.com).  I am
much more likely to work on something if I know that someone else will use it.

* [A Visual Git Reference](https://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/)
  ([source](https://github.com/MarkLodato/vt100-parser))
  — An explanation of how git works through diagrams.

* [scripts](https://github.com/MarkLodato/scripts)
  — Random scripts that I find useful.

* [git-reparent](https://github.com/MarkLodato/git-reparent)
  — A script to manually set the parents of a git commit.  For advanced git
  users only.

* [vt100-parser](https://github.com/MarkLodato/vt100-parser)
  — A program to parse the output of `script` and reproduce in HTML exactly
  as it appeared in its final form on the screen.  It can handle things like
  color, backspaces, alternate screen buffer (used, for example, by `vim` and
  `less`), and more.  Really, this is a full output-only VT100-compatible
  terminal emulator.

* [Enigma Simulator](https://marklodato.github.io/enigma/)
  ([source](https://github.com/MarkLodato/enigma))
  — A visual simulator for the WWII-era Enigma cipher machine.

* [js-boxdrawing](https://github.com/MarkLodato/js-boxdrawing)
  ([demo](https://marklodato.github.io/js-boxdrawing))
  — A JavaScript library to allow the user to make diagrams with the [Unicode
  box-drawing characters][box] by using the arrow keys.

* This site ([source](https://github.com/MarkLodato/marklodato.github.com)) is
  created with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

* [mediawiki-aafigure](https://github.com/MarkLodato/mediawiki-aafigure)
  — MediaWiki extension to allow you to embed [aafigure][] diagrams in Wiki
  pages.  This is nice because the diagram's source is easily
  understandable and versioned right with the page itself, and the output
  isn't bad looking.

* [svnedit](https://github.com/MarkLodato/svnedit)
  — Script to parse and modify svn dump file, say to change usernames from one
  format to another.

### Dead Projects

These are likely to be of no use to anyone anymore.

* [cython_freeze](https://github.com/MarkLodato/cython_freeze)
  — Equivalent of freeze.py for Cython. Allows you to create a stand-alone
  executable using Cython, as opposed to a module that must be imported.  This
  has been incorporated into the real Cython distribution, so there is no need
  for this repo anymore.

* [git-ssh-server](https://github.com/MarkLodato/git-ssh-server)
  — A restricted shell for managing GitHub-like sites through SSH.  Think of
  setting up a GitHub without having a web server.  I never really finished
  this, and better alternatives exist, I think.

* [GitHub Contest entry](https://github.com/MarkLodato/gh-contest)
  — My entry in the 2009 GitHub contest.
