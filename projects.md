## Projects

If you find anything useful, [let me know](mailto:lodatom@gmail.com).  I am
much more likely to work on something if I know that someone else will use it.

### Active Projects

* [vt100-parser](http://github.com/MarkLodato/vt100-parser) &mdash;
  A VT100-compatible, output-only terminal emulator.  The main purpose is to
  parse the output of the `script` program and produce HTML.

* [cython\_freeze](http://github.com/MarkLodato/cython_freeze) &mdash;
  Equivalent of freeze.py for Cython. Allows you to create a stand-alone
  executable using Cython, as opposed to a module that must be imported.

* [git-ssh-server](http://github.com/MarkLodato/git-ssh-server) &mdash; A
  restricted shell for managing GitHub-like sites through SSH.  Think of
  setting up a GitHub without having a web server.

* [This site](http://github.com/MarkLodato/marklodato.github.com) is created
  using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

### Finished Projects

* [svnedit](http://github.com/MarkLodato/svnedit) &mdash; Script to parse and
  modify svn dump file, say to change usernames from one format to another.

* [GitHub Contest entry](http://github.com/MarkLodato/gh-contest) &mdash;
  My entry in the 2009 GitHub contest.
